# üêê Goat Aggressive Behavior Dataset

This dataset contains images with keypoint annotations and a supplementary set of video clips for research on goat behavior, particularly aggressive interactions. It is suitable for tasks such as pose estimation, behavior recognition, and movement analysis using keypoint-based methods.

## Dataset Overview

1. Keypoint Image Dataset

Images: Contain various goat behaviors, including standing, lying down, scratching, and movement interactions. Images are provided in standard formats (e.g., .jpg, .png).

Annotations: Keypoints are annotated in YOLOv8 format, with each point corresponding to specific goat body parts (head, limbs, etc.).

2. Video Clips for Behavior Recognition

New: We have added a subset of categorized video clips, including aggressive and non-aggressive goat interactions.

These videos are intended to support reproducibility of aggres behavior recognition experiments.
